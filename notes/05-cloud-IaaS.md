# Module 05 - Cloud & Infrastructure as a Service Basics
Last updated: 3 May 2024
Status:  [In progress]


## Best Practices to remember
- create a user that is not root --> you'll need to create the ~/.ssh/authorize_keys and set up so you login as laura@<ipaddressoftheserver>, not as root@<...>



## Commands 
... there was a grep that we used that was useful


- ways to check if your app is running: 
aux ps
netstat -lpnt


## Setup Issues / configs that came up
- java sdk 17 is compatible with gradle 7.3.1  
- gradle WSL is installed in your ~/opt


## To dos 
- uninstall the gradle 4.4 that's on WSL (usr\share\gradle i think?)
